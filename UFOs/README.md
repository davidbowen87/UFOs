# UFO Analysis

## Overview of the project. 

The overview of the project is to allow Dana and any usee to filter UFO sightings based on multiple criteria.
While previously filtering 1 criteria was helpful, the revised work allows us to dig a little deeper by City, State, Country and shape of the sighting itself. For the finished product, we also removed the filter button so all of the data filters as you apply your input. 

### Results from the Analysis. 

The results from the analysis are pretty in depth, we can see that there is only 1 log entered based on the search criteria in state selected as "VA" through the supplied data. We can also see that there are 8 logs for searching 1/12/2010, all inside the United States. From that date range, we can see the OR has 2 logs. 

The supplied images show how to use the search functions for the site. Once you input values, you can either move to the next filter box to apply additional rules or just hit "enter" on your keyboard. 

### Summary from the Analysis. 
One drawback from this webpage is that the search is very specific and I don't feel as if it's the most user-friendly in regards that you have to search dates by using the format example provided in the box. Another drawback is that all filters that include text format must be lower case. 

For further development, I would recommend addtional filters to include a search through the comments, I would also recommend changing the code to where the date format is uniform, such as 01/01/2010. 

I would recommend allowing a differnce in the code to allow searches via text to not be as exact, I modified the code through this process to the input was == and then just a single =, the search rules were the same for the ==, but the single = actaully changed information on the page which I thought was neat but odd.
